**Arduino Silly Keyboard** forked from  Arduino HID Project 2.4.4
=========================

This is targetted at the Leonardo or compatible boards (32U4) and will be built around one of these:

It's going to act like a keyboard (HID) and will write random words at random times with the purpose of being an entertaining toy for the office to play (innocent) jokes on colleagues.

If I get clever, then it will insert words at just the right time when someone is typing - for example when the space bar is pressed and it's the perfect perfect time to insert a new new word word. Replay replay retyping things that were already typed would also be great. But I have some learning to do first! 

The project will advance more when the hardware arrives (sometime in the next 5-6 weeks).
